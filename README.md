# potber-api

## Description

potber-api is a RESTful API for the german board [forum.mods.de](https://forum.mods.de) built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest). The API is a modern JSON API that comes with full OpenAPI documentation and follows REST meticulously.

## How to use the API

You can find the OpenAPI documentation here:

- [Staging environment](https://test-api.potber.de/swagger)
- [Production environment](https://api.potber.de/swagger)

### CORS

Even though the API was built primarily for serving [potber-client](https://github.com/spuxx1701/potber-client), it was designed with the ability of serving other usescases in mind. If you need your application's hostname added to the API's allowed origins, feel free to contact me.

### Authentication & authorization

In contrast to the original forum and its API, almost all potber-api routes require you to be signed in. Since potber-api follows modern standards and patterns, it also makes it much easier to extract a lot of data. Thus, restricting access to forum members was done to decrease the risk of abuse. To find out whether a route requires authentication, check the route description for one of the following tags:

- `ðŸ”’ Protected` - You need to be signed in to access this route.
- `ðŸ”“ Open Access` - This route can be used without signing in.

To properly create and maintain a session, follow these steps:

1. Send a `POST` request to `/auth/login` including a body that follows the [expected schema](http://localhost:3000/swagger#/Authentication/AuthController_login).
2. In case of a successful login (the response will have HTTP status code `200`), retrieve the entire `access_token` value from the response body and store it (e.g. in a cookie).
3. In all subsequent requests, you need to include the retrieved value as a [Bearer token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) in the [Authorization HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization). Make sure to maintain the following syntax (replace `<access_token>` with the retrieved value): `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
4. If you receive HTTP status code `401` you either didn't include the correct header or the token expired. You can simply get a new token by calling `/auth/login` again. If you're unsure, test whether your token is valid by calling `GET /auth/session`.
5. To terminate the session, simply get rid of the token (e.g. by deleting the cookie).

TIP: Check the token at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to understand what it contains and when it will expire.

## Development

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spuxx1701/potber-api.git
$ cd potber-api
$ npm install
```

### Setting up the environment

The application expects a couple of environment variables to be set. In a local environment you may provide them by adding an `.env` file into the root folder and copy the following values. Note that `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` can be any kind of string. It will be used for encrypt the session JWT.

```env
# App
APP_PORT=3000
APP_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:4200
APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Swagger
SWAGGER_TEST_THREAD_ID=219289

# CORS
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:4200

# Authentication
AUTH_JWT_SECRET=***
```

### Running the app
